    "The process starts in the grey column:\n",
    "1. The vector of $G$-functions, the AEV, is denoted by $\\bf G$$_{\\text{Sy}}$, where $\\text{Sy}$ is the atomic symbol.\n",
    "2. The first time around, we'll calculate the AEV of the atom $\\text{C}$. Therefore, the other three atoms are considered to be the carbon's environment. This is denoted by the black (main atom) and light brown arrows (environment atom).\n",
    "3. The AEV is calculated according to the radial and angular ensemble of symmetry functions.\n",
    "4. The completed AEV acts as the _input layer_ of the respective neural network. The NN that calculates the atomic energies is different for each atom type; this is denoted by the color in the NNP's outer ring. Note that the NNP is the same for both hydrogens, or for all kinds of hydrogens in a molecule, no matter how different their chemical environments are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of ANI's biggest strenghts: some classical force fields (such as UFF) that need to distinguish elements such as carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen, according to the atom's hybridization or amount of bonds, so that the appropriate parameters can be loaded into a function for calculating the atom's energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, ANI doesn't need this kind of preprocessing: the AEV of each atom is input directly, and the NN is trusted to be able to distinguish between all the possible atom environments, and calculate the atom's energy accordingly. This distinguishing capability is ensured through very thorough sampling techniques during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The NNP has a single output node: it contains the atom's energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the sum of the atomic energies results in the molecular energy according to the selected ANI model."
