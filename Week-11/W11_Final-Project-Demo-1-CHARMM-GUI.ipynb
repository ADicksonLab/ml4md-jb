    "## Overview of today's demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will build the simulation inputs for a **ligand binding simulation**.  The system will include a protein, multiple copies of a ligand, and a solvent composed of water molecules and ions.  The ligand molecules will be initialized in the \"unbound state\": in random orientations that are freely floating in solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The steps to produce these inputs are as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Locate a structure that contains the protein of interest.  Here we will use the trypsin protein from [1a0j](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1A0J).\n",
    "2.  Use the [PDB Reader](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/pdbreader) to generate `psf` and `crd` files for the protein.  This will allow you to model in missing residues, make mutations, and add modifications to your protein.  The output files contain information on the protein structure (`psf`) and the coordinates of each atom in the protein (`crd`).\n",
    "3.  Use the [Ligand Reader and Modeler](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/ligandrm) to generate files for your ligand.  This can grab ligands from existing pdb files, or upload ligand structures from `mol2`, `SMILES` or `sdf` files.  You can also simply draw the ligand you want!  The outputs will be `psf` files, as well as `rtf` and `prm` files if your ligand is not included in the standard forcefield.\n",
    "4.  Use the [Multicomponent Assembler](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/multicomp) to put these together, with a single copy of the protein and 10 copies of the ligand.  This will construct and minimize the system, and output a set of files we can use to run simulations in OpenMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the inputs are constructed we will run the simulations on HPCC and on Google Colab.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*  For Colab, we need to upload all of the necessary files, install the packages, and use the CHARMM-GUI scripts to launch OpenMM simulations.  Use the `CHARMM_GUI_COLAB.ipynb` notebook on the course webpage for help with this.\n",
    "*  For HPCC, use the `CHARMM_GUI_HPCC.ipynb` notebook on the course webpage."
